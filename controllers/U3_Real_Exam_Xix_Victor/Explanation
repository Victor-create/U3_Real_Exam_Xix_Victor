First define and declare each of the variables that I needed later in the programming

then create a function for each of the movements and within that function Write each and every one of the necessary parameters so that you can fu To want that function

in the shooting function create three levels of detection so that depending on the distance at which the sensor detected wrote more or less TATATAH!

To make my gun turn use a position sensor in the solidness of my distance sensor so I can count the number of turns it gave and get my gun to the exact point and fire
